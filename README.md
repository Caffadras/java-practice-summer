# java-practice-summer (Bank app)

This is my college individual lab. It is a simple bank management app with basic functionality. My aim was to write clean and well-structured code, which can be easily extended in the future if necessary. While I'm not an expert in bank management systems, I focused on the programming aspects of the project rather than the specific functionalities of the app.

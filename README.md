# java-practice-summer

This is my summer project app, which I made during my college practice. 
It is a simple bank app with rather minimal functionality. 
However, my goal was to write a clean code in a well-structured project, which can be easily expanded later, if needed.
I am not an expert in the financial field, thus, I focused on the programming aspect of the project, not the functional side of the app.
